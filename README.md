# README

Based mostly on Hardl's Rails tutorial, created working along with the book itself. Hence the wonky CSS.
I made an oopsie somewhere around there.

Anyway, this returns my repositories and posts it as a "micropost" to an instance of the app through a rake task. 

To run, start a local server with 'rails server', and run rake github:repo_post. That's all it does.
